- 👋 Hi, I’m @RyanGJohnson
- 👀 I’m interested in creating more authentic characters in games and interactive stories by developing GTP-3 and Language Processesing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about developing and implementing existing AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that is RPG game related, story driven or just cutting edge on AI interactivity.
